# TODO list with storage switch
This todo app allows you to:
- create new list items
- mark item as done
- delete items
- manage different todo-lists
- change data storage between browser localStorage and server storage

## Technologies
- Javascript
- Bootstrap 4.5.3
- Node.js (to run the server)

## Setup
Run the `index.js` from server folder using terminal:
```
cd todo-server
node index.js
```
Then you can simply run the main `index.html` to run the app.
I prefer [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) (but you can use something else):
